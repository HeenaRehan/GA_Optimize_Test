# REPOSITORY_TEMPLATE
Template for the creation of repos

# Repository naming convention
When creating a repo, please use the following nomenclature: [PRODUCT]\_[TECH]\_[description].
For instance, for a repo involving SDP, testing Instagram and first version where we are testing blockquote embeding, we would name the repo
**SDP\_INSTAGRAM\_bloquote**.

An extra data that could be used would be to have the nomenclature [product]\_[tech involved]\_[description]\_[version], where version would correspond to repo version, and could be used for alternative implementations of same tech or other situations that could lead us to create a newer version.
